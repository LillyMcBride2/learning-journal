### A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning. By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.
In the words of ALfred Binet:
> Some recent philosophers seem to have given their moral approval to these deplorable verdicts that affirm that the intelligence of an individual is a fixed quantity, a quantity that cannot be augmented. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism; we will try to demonstrate that it is founded on nothing.
#### The growth mindset involves thinking about things in ways that help us to grow intellectually and emotionally. Instead of becoming frustrated by problems we don't understand we are exhilarated by them and excited to figure them out. Instead of being discouraged by criticism we embrace it as an opportunity to see things differently and learn new ways of doing things. We always think of things we don't understand as things we don't understand yet.
#### Reminders

 [x] See challenges as opportunities
 
 [x] Put forth effort and persist
 
 [x] Embrace criticism
 
 [x] Be inspired by the success of others

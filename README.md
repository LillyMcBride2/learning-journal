## The growth mindset involves thinking about things in ways that help us to grow intellectually and emotionally. Instead of becoming frustrated by problems we don't understand, we are exhilarated by them and excited to figure them out. Instead of being discouraged critism we embrace it as an opportunity to see things differently and learn new ways of doing things. We always think of things we don't understand as things we don't understand yet.

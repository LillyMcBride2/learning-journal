# What are Github and Markdown?

GitHub is a great free development tool for programmers. It gives you a place to save your code in what are called repositories.
Each time you edit your code, you can save it to the repository by clicking a button labeled commit. When you commit your code to the
reposity that version of your code is saved to to GitHub. Making it easy to go back and look at earlier versions of the code you're
writing.

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, 
and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic
characters thrown in, like # or *. You can use Markdown most places around GitHub.

Now I'll show you just a few examples of Markdown in action. The slashes I'm about to use indicate a comment, something that is not code, 
just a little note to help people to better understand code. 

To make take text bold you can use either two stars or two uderscores at the beginning and end of the block of text.

---

**This text will be bold.**


__This text will also be bold__

---

To make text italic you can use a single star or a single underscore at the beginning and end of a block of text.

---

*This text will be italisized.*

_This text will also be italisized._


---


To create an erasure you can use two tilde characters at the beginning and end of a block of text.

---

~~This text text will be stricken from the record in a manner similar to way the Rauschenberg earased the drawings of De Kooning. It will
be obvious that something was both enscribed and taken back.~~
